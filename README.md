# AboutMe

Hi there ðŸ‘‹
With a Bachelor's Degree in Management, and as a current Data Science and Engineering Master Student at FEUP, my goal is to become a Data Scientist with a business and added value perspectives very much required for this role, in the short-term.

In the long-term I'm aiming to become a Project Manager (or Portfolio Manager) regarding Data Science projects. After all the knowledge I acquired through this ambitious journey, I want to achieve the top rankings of a company's organogram, applying my corporate and data science perspectives in driving the company foward, always striving for excellence.

Right now, my focus is in extracting as much knowledge as possible from the Master's Degree I'm enrolled in, as well as from its professors. On the other hand, I want to take advantage of the Faculty's infrastructure and resources, as well as putting into practice the knowledge acquired. Therefore, I will be working as a fellow researcher in a big project, starting in January 2023 in INESC TEC, where I will directly apply what I'm learning in my Master's Degree.

I am multi-skilled, which means that my greatest strength is my versatility to achieve great results in different areas. It also means that I can learn fast about almost any topic, especially when I am interested in learning about it!
